#Demo platform game created with Phaser

Phaser requires a local HTTP server to run games locally, but thanks to github "Pages" feature, it is possible to [test projects online](https://jumpjack.github.io/pasher3-platform-demo/).

I am studying this game to try implementing [my JS version  of Space1999Adventure](https://github.com/jumpjack/Space1999Adventure).

Phaser supports isometric games since version 3.5.0, and it also supports TMJ files created with Tiled for maps.
